# Plot.ly Challenge - Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose:

Utilize the D3 and Plot.ly Javascript libraries to explore and visualize the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

## Steps:

- **Build the Javascript code to visualize the data**

1. Read in `samples.json` using the D3 library.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

3. Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

4. Display the sample metadata.

5. Update all of the plots any time that a new sample is selected.

6. Finally, build `index.html` to aesthetically deploy the data and its associated visualizations.
